# üñåÔ∏è Automatic Image Colorization

This is an enhanced implementation of the [_Let there be Color!_](http://iizuka.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/projects/colorization/en/) model by Satoshi Iizuka, Edgar Simo-Serra, and Hiroshi Ishikawa, modified by the research team at Nazarbayev University. Our adaptation, named ColNet+, narrows down the focus from the original 365 classes to an optimized set of 12 classes, integrating a dropout layer on low-level features to prevent overfitting, and incorporating global average pooling to replace the first two fully connected layers for a more robust and generalized feature representation.

This project has been updated as discussed in our latest research paper from Nazarbayev University. The following files have been added to extend the capabilities of our colorization framework:

- `stats.py`: for generating statistical data about colorization results.
- `comparison.py`: to compare the performance and results of different colorization models.
- `tsne.py`: for dimensionality reduction and visualization of color spaces.
- `colorize.py`: have been updated in the plot_dl folder to colorize images without google colab, plot the results and see the classification results   
## First Run

[Places12-Standard](http://places365.csail.mit.edu/download.html) dataset will be downloaded and split into _train/dev/test_ subsets with a focused set of 12 categories. Here the original model have 365 classes but we only filtered out the below classes due to computational limitations:
BEACH
HOSPITAL_ROOM
BOOKSTORE
FIELD-CULTIVATED
ZEN_GARDEN
TOPIARY_GARDEN
BAR
DORM_ROOM
CAFETERIA
ARCADE
FOUNTAIN
TOWER

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/antechsky/colnet-modified.git
$ cd colnet-modified
$ make dataset
'''If you want to split data only with 12 clases run the command below''':
$ make new_new_split 
'''Otherwise run normal command below''' 
$ make split
```

## Requirements

Code is written in Python 3.6.3. All requirements can be installed via:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Network Training

To train the ColNet+ network with new configurations:

```bash
$ python3 loader.py config/places12.yaml
```

Model checkpoints are saved every epoch and training can be resumed with a saved model:

```bash
$ python3 loader.py config/places12.yaml --model model.pt
```

## Colorize!

To colorize an image with your chosen model:

```bash
$ python3 colorize.py img.jpg ./models/places12.pt
```

Please refer to the changes and methodologies discussed in our paper for a deeper understanding of these updates.
